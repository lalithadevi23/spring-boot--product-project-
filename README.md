# spring-boot-product-project
**INTRODUCTION**
The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Spring Boot, SpringToolSuite, and MySQL serves the purpose of providing a robust and user-friendly system for managing data.
Its scope encompasses: 1) Data Managemenet  2) Technoligical Stack   3) Scalability  4) Customization 
Overall, the CRUD application streamlines data management operations, making it an essential tool for businesses and organizations to efficiently handle their data-related tasks.
**SETTING UP THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT**
To set up the development environment for the CRUD application using Spring Tool Suite (STS), follow these instructions, including the necessary prerequisites:
Prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK):
   - Ensure you have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed. The application is built with Java, and you'll need this to compile and run the code. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
2. Spring Tool Suite (STS):
   - Download and install Spring Tool Suite (STS) from the official website (https://spring.io/tools).
3. MySQL Database:
   - Install MySQL if not already installed. You can download the MySQL Community Server from the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

**PROJECT PROCEDURE OF CRUD APPLICATION FOR PRODUCT**
1) Firstly setup the  requried software to the machince.
2) Using Spring Boot just opened the Spring Tool Suite for Developing the business logic.
3) Created the project with layer like Entity layer, Service layer, Repository layer, Controller layer.
4) Entity layer have the Variable Declaration and Lombok (toString , Setter , Getter , AllArgsConstructor, NoArgsConstructor) to avoid bowl code.
5) In Service layer, developed the business logic code. In Repository layer, created the JPA code.In Controller layer,developed the Controllers of the Http controllers.
6) Using Application.properites  linked JDBC connectivity.
7) Created the Database in MySQL for storing the data into Database.
8)  After completion of backend  code, we need to check the project by using Postman API for backend purpose because every business logic is working or not, we need to find out. By using Postman API, data is pushed into database, we need to check it and in the given below pictures, you can see the CRUD operation is working.
